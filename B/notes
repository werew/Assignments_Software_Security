Use iterative algorithms in order to avoid stack overflows
--- Double check specs at the end
For ease of correction and in order to show that the bugs were understood 
the list of bugs found on top of each function
this is particulary true for the function `read_data` which, in order to 
avoid the unsafe behaviour of `sscanf` when parsing numeric values, has been
almost completely reimplemented (using the safest function `strtol` in order
to parse the user provided integer).


(It is not enough to reimplement the function and thus not showing you understand the bugs)

The behaviour has been respected


//TODO add tests
